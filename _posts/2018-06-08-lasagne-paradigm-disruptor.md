Here's another one of my world-class recipes, the lasagna "Paradigm Disruptor".

# Ingredients

340 g | mozzarella
330 g | lasagna sheets

For the bechamel sauce:

80 g | flour
80 g | butter
500 ml | vegetable stock
500 ml | milk
2 ts | parslay
½ ts | nutmeg


For the bolognese sauce:

265 g | onions
750 g | minced meat
900 g | puréed & diced tomatoes (half and half)
18g | garlic
1 ts | basil
1 ts | oregano
1 ts | paprika
½ ts | pepper
1 ts | salt

# Preparation

Prepare the bechamel and the bolognese sauce, preheat your oven to 190°C and layer the sauces and lasagna sheets evenly.

The last layer must be a sauce layer (bechamel or bolognese doesn't matter) and is topped with the mozzarella.

Bake the lasagna for approximately 30 minutes.
