title: Script to merge a Git branch into the upper branch

keywords: "Git, script, merge, upper, upperer, branch"

If using a development process that consists of multiple stages of maturity,
development mainly progresses in one branch only. I often use a process that
consists of the three branches 'develop', 'staging' and 'master', so in my
case the development mainline is 'develop'. You might want to check out my
post on how to
[enforce or safeguard such a development process]({% post_url 2018-09-20-git-pre-commit-hooks-best-practices %}).

If the development process also advocates the use of feature branches, the
'develop' branch often is in a state that is mature enough to be merged into
the upper branch.

To aid in this process I developed a little script to merge the current
branch into the upper branch. The script removes the need to issue a bunch
of Git commands and performs the following tasks:
* check for unclean working copies prior merging
* checkout target branch and pull from origin
* merge from lower branch
* push to origin
* repeat the last three steps for the branch higher than the target branch

The script asks for confirmation before every action and assumes relatively
save defaults (it's e.g. not the default to directly merge up into
master/production).

The script works for a process with three stages ('develop', 'staging',
'master') as well as for one with two stages ('develop', 'master') -- the
stages must be named as described, however.

The script is executed by just calling `merge-up` when in a Git working copy
that has either the branch 'develop' or 'staging' checked out.
